**Key Corrections:**

- **Code Blocks:** Enclosed code snippets within triple backticks (```) to properly format them as code blocks. This is the standard Markdown syntax for code blocks. citeturn0search0

- **Lists:** Ensured that list items are properly formatted with asterisks (*) for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists, followed by a space. citeturn0search2

- **References:** Removed the `:contentReference[oaicite:...]` tags, as they are not standard in Markdown and may have been added by a Markdown editor or converter.

This revised README should now render correctly on GitHub and other Markdown parsers.
